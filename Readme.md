### NNpkg

package of NN_clean: https://github.com/Kelvinthedrugger/NN_clean
 , so that it's easier to import from cloud

According to @geohot, a package that has been built for 4 times
 would be usable, tho my coding skill is less than 0.01% of his
 , we can still do it in this way and see if the rules applied.


#### usage
    
    # on cloud
    !git clone https://github.com/Kelvinthedrugger/NeuralNetworkPackage.git 
    
    # test if it has been sucessfully imported
    from NeuralNetworkPackage import lib as nn
