for saving the trained model:
    use pickle pkg in python
    and Dict data structure


features:
    
    add lr_finder: super-convergence by Lesile Smith: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120 

    add Flatten() layer (or unsqueeze() in pytorch): basically just dimension re-arrangement

    add LSTM: without this, this package would be very limited when applying it
